# Multi-Omics-Integration-for-PDAC-Stratification
This repository contains the implementation of an integrative scientific visualization and data analysis framework for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient stratification, developed for the Scientific Visualization course (A.Y. 2025/2026, University of Milan).

# Overview
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by pronounced molecular heterogeneity and limited effectiveness of conventional clinical classification systems. Traditional staging and histopathological criteria often fail to capture the underlying biological diversity of the disease, motivating the need for integrative, data-driven approaches.

This project explores multi-omics data integration as a strategy to uncover latent molecular structure in PDAC. Six complementary omics layers - circRNA, miRNA, mRNA, phosphoproteome, proteome, and somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) - are integrated using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to construct a unified patient similarity network. The resulting network is analyzed through advanced visualization techniques, clustering methods, and predictive modeling to identify molecular subtypes and assess their clinical relevance.
